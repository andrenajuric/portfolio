                <p>
                    I am 24 years old. I graduated from UW Seattle in 2018 with a bachelor's degree in Sociology. I went
                    in to UW as a pre-biology major. After a couple quarters, I realized it wasn't for me and I set my
                    sights on computer science as it was always an interest of mine. After I struggled through the
                    introductory class and received a barely passing grade, I was dissuaded away from continuing that
                    pursuit. It has always been my biggest regret. Now I am enrolled in a coding bootcamp offered
                    through UW, so that I can give it another try and hope that it leads to a career change.
                    <br><br>
                    As of right now, I am a customer service representative for Cadman Inc., a company that provides
                    ready-mix concrete, asphalt, sand & gravel to contractors and homeowners. I have learned a lot
                    within the past 2 years that I've worked there, but I lack passion in the work that I do. The work
                    that I've done in this bootcamp so far has been extremely challenging, but also very rewarding.
                    We've tackled basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, third-party API's, and we are now getting into
                    Node. I recently completed my first group project; my group members and I developed a website using
                    a third-party API that would recommend certain cocktails based on the users current location and
                    time of day. I have learned a lot since the course has started, I practice every day, and I look
                    forward to sharpening my skills so that I may someday translate these skills into an actual career.
