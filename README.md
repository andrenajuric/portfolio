## <u>Web Development Portfolio</u>

<br/>

### About Me:

> I am 24 year olds with aspirations of becoming a web developer/UI designer. I am currently enrolled at the UW Coding Bootcamp. So far, I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and I am currently learning Node. We have completed 1 group project so far; my group developed an app that generates random cocktails depending on current time and weather. I am updating this portfolio to showcase some of the work I have done

### Task

To create an updated responsive portfolio that showcases at least 3 exemplary assignments. 

## Process

I used the portfolio that I had started for Assignment 2. I made CSS changes and made the page functional - using actual links rather than placeholders. I updated the resume section on my linkedin & used that as a link to my resume.
